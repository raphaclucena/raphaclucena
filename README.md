# 👋 Hello Coders! I'm Rapha!

Welcome to my corner of the internet — a place where code meets creativity. 🚀

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a **VFX artist, art director, and digital designer** who believes creation has no boundaries.

For over a decade, I’ve shaped stories with Netflix, Globo Filmes, Amazon Prime Video, MAX and beyond.

In code, I found another language for imagination — front-end, back-end, Python — new colors for my canvas.

Art and programming dance together, building worlds that can be seen, felt, and experienced.

Here, every line of code is a brushstroke of possibility.

## 🎯 What Drives Me
Art, in all its forms, is what moves me — it’s the lens through which I see and shape the world.

Solving real problems through creativity is my fuel, blending logic and imagination into something tangible.

I believe art and creativity are what make reality magical, turning ideas into new worlds, identities and visual solutions.

Each project is a chance to expand the universe through the endless bridges between different artistic fields.

In every discipline, I find new ways to spark imagination and build the extraordinary.
